# Jeffrey
Jeffrey is a 32-bit vst2. You can see Jeffrey in use with FL Studio 12 down below. To test Jeffrey yourself, you need to use a DAW capable of running 32-bit VSTs, then simply drag Jeffrey.dll into your VST folder.

**Things I'd like to add:**
* More LFO options
* More wavetable options
* More advanced ASDR envelope creation
* Ability to map LFOs and envelopes to any parameter
* More voices, with the ability to detune
